The second half of the year has begun and it seems like everyone’s got new goals. The beginning of the year did not go as planned for most of us, so we’ve had to spend our time rescheduling, retreating, redirecting and renewing. Basically, everything “RE”, but let’s talk about Renewing our minds.

The Bible says not to act like the world, but be transformed by the renewal of our minds so we can know and act according to God’s will.

What do you want the latter part of the year to be like??

If you’re stuck at home doing nothing, why not engage in activities that make you happy, making your time worthwhile. It can be boring, sometimes depressing, but what are you going to do about it? Here are some ideas; Bingewatch series, read books, journal, learn a craft or an art, take online classes, basically do more with your time.

You could also engage and talk to people. If you ever feel overwhelmed, call someone. Call an old friend, pick up from where you left off and laugh about memories. You’ll feel much better in the end.

This COVID season seems to have awakened a lot of talents in different individuals. People are starting businesses and discovering talents they never knew they had. Have you discovered yours? Engage in acts of self discovery.

Finally, treat yourself. This includes taking good care of yourself too. While you may decide that a whole box of cupcakes is the perfect treat, remember to engage in regular exercises. Balance is necessary.
Finally, stay safe out there. The virus knows no age, status or colour. 

Have fun and sanitise.
